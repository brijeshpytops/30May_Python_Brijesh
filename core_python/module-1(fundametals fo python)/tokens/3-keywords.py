Welcome to Python 3.12's help utility! If this is your first time using
Python, you should definitely check out the tutorial at
https://docs.python.org/3.12/tutorial/.

Enter the name of any module, keyword, or topic to get help on writing
Python programs and using Python modules.  To get a list of available
modules, keywords, symbols, or topics, enter "modules", "keywords",
"symbols", or "topics".

Each module also comes with a one-line summary of what it does; to list
the modules whose name or summary contain a given string such as "spam",
enter "modules spam".

To quit this help utility and return to the interpreter,
enter "q" or "quit".

Here is a list of the Python keywords.  Enter any keyword to get more help.

False               class               from                or
None                continue            global              pass
True                def                 if                  raise
and                 del                 import              return
as                  elif                in                  try
assert              else                is                  while
async               except              lambda              with
await               finally             nonlocal            yield
break               for                 not



False: The statement is false.

class: The class defines the blueprint for objects.

from: You can import specific functions or variables from a module using "from."

or: You can use the "or" operator to evaluate if at least one condition is true.

None: If a function doesn't explicitly return a value, it implicitly returns None.

continue: The continue statement skips the rest of the loop's code block and continues with the next iteration.

global: The global keyword allows you to modify a variable outside of the current scope.

pass: The pass statement is a null operation, often used as a placeholder in Python code.

True: The statement is true.

def: The def keyword is used to define functions in Python.

if: The if statement is used for conditional execution.

raise: You can use the raise statement to raise an exception.

and: The "and" operator is used to evaluate if both conditions are true.

del: The del keyword is used to delete objects in Python.

import: The import statement is used to import modules in Python.

return: The return statement is used to exit a function and return a value.

as: The as keyword is used for aliasing in Python.

elif: The elif statement is used in conjunction with if to evaluate multiple conditions.

in: The "in" keyword is used to check if a value exists within a sequence.

try: The try statement is used for exception handling.

assert: The assert statement is used to assert a condition, if the condition is false, it raises an AssertionError.

else: The else statement is used in conjunction with if to execute a block of code if the condition is false.

is: The "is" operator is used to test if two variables refer to the same object.

while: The while loop is used for repeated execution as long as a condition is true.

async: The async keyword is used to define asynchronous functions.

except: The except statement is used to catch exceptions in Python.

lambda: The lambda keyword is used to create anonymous functions.

with: The with statement is used to wrap the execution of a block of code within methods defined by a context manager.

await: The await keyword is used to pause the execution of an asynchronous function until a result is available.

finally: The finally statement is used in conjunction with try to define a block of code to be executed regardless of whether an exception is raised or not.

nonlocal: The nonlocal keyword is used to declare that a variable is not local to the current function's scope.

yield: The yield statement is used inside a function to pause and save the state of the function, returning a generator.

break: The break statement is used to exit a loop prematurely.

for: The for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, dictionary, string, etc.).

not: The "not" operator is used to negate a boolean value.
