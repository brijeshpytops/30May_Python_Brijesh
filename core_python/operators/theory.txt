Operators are special symbols or keywords used to perform operations on variables and values. They can be classified into several types based on their functionality. 

x = 10
y = 20
z = x + y

x,y,z - Oprands
=, + - Operators

Arithmetic Operators: Used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.
+ (Addition)
- (Subtraction)
* (Multiplication)
/ (Division)
% (Modulus)
** (Exponentiation)
// (Floor Division)

Assignment\Shorthand Operators: Used to assign values to variables.
= (Assign)
+= (Add and assign)
-= (Subtract and assign)
*= (Multiply and assign)
/= (Divide and assign)
%= (Modulus and assign)
**= (Exponentiate and assign)
//= (Floor divide and assign)


Comparison (Relational) Operators: Used to compare values and return True or False.
== (Equal to)
!= (Not equal to)
> (Greater than)
< (Less than)
>= (Greater than or equal to)
<= (Less than or equal to)


Identity Operators: Used to compare the memory locations of two objects.
is (Returns True if both variables point to the same object)
is not (Returns True if both variables point to different objects)

Membership Operators: Used to check if a value is present in a sequence (lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, strings).
in (Returns True if the specified value is present in the sequence)
not in (Returns True if the specified value is not present in the sequence)


Logical Operators: Used to combine conditional statements.
and (Logical AND)
or (Logical OR)
not (Logical NOT)


Bitwise Operators: Used to perform bitwise operations on integers.
& (Bitwise AND)
| (Bitwise OR)
^ (Bitwise XOR)
~ (Bitwise NOT)
<< (Left shift)
>> (Right shift)
